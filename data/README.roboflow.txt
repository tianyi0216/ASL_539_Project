The dataset includes 1728 images.
Letters are annotated in Tensorflow Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 512x512 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -5 and +5 degrees
* Random shear of between -5째 to +5째 horizontally and -5째 to +5째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.25 pixels
